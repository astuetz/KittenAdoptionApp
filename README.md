## :scroll: Description
Help kittens find a home!
Browse through tons of cute cats (not just kittens need new homes!), read more about each of them and choose your future companion.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Proud to finally build something "real" with Compose and also to show off my cat :><br>
Change `NUM_OF_ADDITIONAL_KITTENS` inside `KittensProvider.kt` to see more or less cats!<br>
Random cat pictures coming from cataas.com!
